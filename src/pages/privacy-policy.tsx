              <li>
                displaying marketing content to the User that is not adapted to

              In order to carry out marketing activities, the Controller in some

              the Users in order to analyse their behaviour or to create a
              forecast for the future. This allows for better adjustment of the
              displayed content to the individual preferences and interests of
              the Users.

              order processing, until the withdrawal of the expressed consent or
              filing an effective objection to data processing in cases where
              the legal basis of data processing is the legitimate interest of
