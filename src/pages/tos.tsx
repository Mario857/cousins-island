				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Copyright Complaints]</strong>
					</div>
					The Company respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our
					users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a
					way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual
					property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify the Company
					of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth
					below.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Company will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement
					and will take appropriate actions under the applicable intellectual
					property laws of Poland with respect to any alleged or actual infringement.
					A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to
					hello@COUSIN.io (Subject line: “Infringement Notice”). To be effective, the
					notification must be in writing and contain the following information:
					<ul>
						<li>
							an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on
							behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property
							interest;
						</li>
						<li>
							a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that
							you claim has been infringed;{' '}
						</li>
						<li>
							a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is
							located on the Platform, with enough detail that we may find it on the
							Platform;{' '}
						</li>
						<li>your address, telephone number, and email address; </li>
						<li>
							a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed
							use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner,
							its agent, or the law;{' '}
						</li>
						<li>
							a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
							information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or
							intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or
							intellectual property owner’s behalf.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Counter-Notice]</strong>
					</div>
					If you believe your NFT Content that was removed (or to which access was
					disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the
					copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, pursuant to the law, to
					upload and use the content in your NFT Content, you may e-mail us a written
					counter-notice to hello@COUSIN.io, containing the following information:
					<ul>
						<li>
							your physical or electronic signature; identification of the content that
							has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at
							which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
						</li>
						<li>
							a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was
							removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the
							content;{' '}
						</li>
						and
						<li>
							your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that
							you consent to the jurisdiction of Ireland and a statement that you will
							accept service of process from the person who provided notification of

						</li>
					</ul>
					If a counter-notice is received by the Company we will send a copy of the
					counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that
					it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 7 (seven)
					business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
					order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may
					be replaced, or access to it restored, up to 14 (fourteen) business days or
					more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
				</p>
				<h3>What fees does COUSIN charge?</h3>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Fees]</strong>
					</div>
					There are four kinds of fees on the Platform:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Launchpad fees for minting NFTs that are calculated as a fraction (5-10%)
							of the NFT price;
						</li>
						<li>
							Marketplace fees for trading NFTs that are calculated as a fraction
							(5-10%) of the value of a Transaction (charged only when the Transaction
							is executed) and a fixed fee of 0.2 UST for every operation while using
							the Marketplace Service (posting a buy or sell order, cancelling or
							executing an order, listing or delisting a Digital Asset, adding or
							withdrawing funds, “minting” a Digital Asset);
						</li>
						<li>
							Staking fees when you unstake a Digital Asset – a fixed fee of 1 UST per
							a request to unstake a Digital Asset and a fixed fee of 1 UST when
							Unbounding period is finished;
						</li>
						<li>
							Instant unbounding fees that are calculated as a fraction (5-10%) of the
							value of Digital Assets subject to unstaking.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					All Transactions on the Platform, including without limitation “minting”,
					listing, offering, purchasing, or executing, are facilitated by smart
					contracts existing on the Terra blockchain that requires the Gas fee. The
					Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the
					control of the Company. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances a
					contract, agreement, offer, sale, or other transaction on the Platform
					becomes invalid, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the
					basis that the Gas Fee for the given Transaction was unknown, too high, or
					otherwise unacceptable.
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Taxes]</strong>
					</div>
					Users are solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and
					other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by
					any governmental authority, associated with your use of the Platform
					(including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the
					result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, sale, or creation of any
					Digital Asset).
				</p>

				<h3>Risks associated with cryptography</h3>

				<p>
					You accept and acknowledge each of the following risks:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in
							the price of all kinds of virtual assets could materially and adversely
							affect the value of your Digital Asset, which may also be subject to
							significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of
							the Digital Asset will not lose money.
						</li>
						<li>
							Tokens are tangible digital assets that exist only by virtue of the
							ownership record maintained in the given blockchain. All smart contracts
							are conducted and occur on the decentralized ledger. We have no control
							over, and make no guarantees, warranties or promises with in relation to
							smart contracts.
						</li>
						<li>
							We will not be liable to you for any losses you incur as the result of
							your use of the given blockchain. This includes, but is not limited to,
							losses, damages or claims arising from (i) user error (e.g. forgotten
							access information such as private keys, seeds or mnemonics or
							incorrectly construed smart contracts or other transactions); (ii) server
							failure or data loss; (iii) corrupted wallet files; (iv) unauthorized
							access or activities by third parties, including but not limited to the
							use of viruses, phishing, or other means of attack against the Platform,
							the given blockchain, the Wallet or any other tool connected to the
							Platform. We are also not responsible for losses due to blockchains and
							Wallets or any other tool connected to the Platform, including but not
							limited to late report (or no report) by developers or representatives of
							any issues with the blockchain supporting the given blockchain, including
							forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a
							result.
						</li>
						<li>
							There are inherent security risks in providing information and dealing
							online over the internet. The Company implements appropriate
							technological and organizational safeguards to reduce the risk of any
							security breaches which could result in the accidental or unlawful
							destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or access to your information.
							We also release periodic updates to reduce the risk of security
							incidents.
						</li>
						<li>
							There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
							including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and
							Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and
							the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information
							stored within your Wallet. You accept and acknowledge that the Company
							will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
							errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the given
							blockchain, however caused.
						</li>
						<li>
							A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
							distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the
							COUSIN ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Digital
							Assets available on the Platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Platform, the Terra blockchain and Digital Assets could be impacted
							by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could
							impede or limit the ability of the Company to continue to develop the
							Platform, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use
							the Platform or the given blockchain, including access to your Digital
							Assets or other funds, and new regulations or policies may materially
							adversely affect the development of the COUSIN ecosystem, and therefore
							the potential utility of the Tokens.
						</li>
						<li>
							You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field.
							Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development
							of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, digital
							assets and the Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of your
							Digital Assets. To the extent possible, it is intended to update the
							protocol underlying the Platform to account for any advances in
							cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does
							not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By
							using the Platform, you acknowledge these inherent risks.
						</li>
						<li>
							Any use or interaction with the Platform requires a comprehensive
							understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to
							appreciate inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent
							and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference
							to a type of Digital Assets on the Platform does not indicate our
							approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding such type
							of Digital Assets, and should not be used as a substitute for your own
							understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset. We
							make no warranty as to the suitability of the Digital Assets referenced
							on the Platform and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use of the Platform, in particular for creating, buying or selling the
							Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their
							nature, highly experimental, risky and volatile. You acknowledge and
							agree that you will access and use the Platform at your own risk. The
							risk of loss in trading the Digital Assets can be substantial. You
							should, therefore, carefully consider whether such creating, buying or
							selling Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of your circumstances
							and financial resources. By using the Platform, you represent that you
							have been, are and will be solely responsible for making your own
							independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given
							transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you
							have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and
							experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any
							transaction conducted via the Platform or any underlying Digital Assets.
							You accept all consequences of using the Platform, including the risk
							that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All
							Transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in
							these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no
							circumstances be liable to you in connection with use of the Platform for
							performing Transactions. Under no circumstances will the operation of all
							or any portion of the Platform be deemed to create a relationship that
							includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.
						</li>
						<li>
							You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The
							Platform may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in
							activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause
							interruptions to or delays on the Platform. You agree to accept the risk
							of the Platform failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened
							technical difficulties. We do not guarantee that the Platform is or will
							remain updated, complete, correct or secure, or that access to the
							Platform will be uninterrupted. The Platform may include inaccuracies,
							errors and materials that violate or conflict with these Terms.
							Additionally, third parties may make unauthorized alterations to the
							Platform or the software underlying the Platform. Accordingly, you should
							verify all information on the Platform before relying on it, and all
							decisions based on information contained on the Platform are your sole
							responsibility and we will have no liability for such decisions.

				</p>

				<h3>Third-Party services</h3>
				<p>
					The Services may include Third-Party services or contain links to
					Third-Party services. You understand that Third-Party services are the

				<h3>Prohibited Uses</h3>
				<p>
					Prior to your use of the Services and on an ongoing basis you represent,
					warrant, and agree that:
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Jurisdictions]</strong>
					</div>
					You are not located in or you are not a resident of any jurisdiction in
					which it is prohibited to use the Services and therefore you are not
					permitted to make use of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the
					foregoing restrictions on Services from Prohibited Jurisdictions applies
					equally to residents and citizens of other nations while located in a
					Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent the restrictions by any
					persons located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction, is a breach of this Terms. An
					attempt at circumvention includes, but is not limited to, manipulating the
					information used to identify the Users location and providing false or
					misleading information regarding the Users location or place of residence.
					If any provision of these Terms is or becomes illegal, invalid or
					unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect the validity or
					enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision hereof or the
					validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of that or any other
					provision hereof.
				</p>

				<p>
					Due to the rather uncertain and volatile regulatory environment surrounding
					virtual asset activities (including cryptocurrencies), every User shall
					each time prior to using the Services verify if he/she is not located in
					the Prohibited Jurisdiction or is not a resident or citizen of a Prohibited
					Jurisdiction.
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Personal use]</strong>
					</div>
					The Service is intended solely for the User’s personal use. The User is
					only allowed to use the Service for personal use, and may not create
					multiple accounts, including for the purpose of collusion and/or abuse of
					service.
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[KYC and AML Policy]</strong>
					</div>
					The Company expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Services for any
					form of illicit activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing
					or trade sanctions violations, consistent with various Applicable’ laws,
					regulations and norms. To that end, the Services are not offered to
					individuals or entities on any Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) lists,
					or subject to any United States, European Union or other global sanctions
					or watch lists. By using the Service, you represent that you are not on any
					such lists.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>
						ALL USERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND DECLARE THAT THEIR FUNDS COME FROM LEGITIMATE
						SOURCES AND DO NOT ORIGINATE FROM ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES; USERS AGREE THAT THE
						COMPANY MAY REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE OR OTHERWISE COLLECT THE NECESSARY
						INFORMATION AND MATERIALS AS PER RELEVANT LAWS OR GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO
						VERIFY THE LEGALITY OF THE SOURCES AND USE OF THEIR FUNDS.
					</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					The Company will maintain a stance of cooperation with law enforcement
					authorities globally and will not hesitate to terminate Users’ access to
					the Platform on the basis of the legal mandate.
				</p>

				<h3>Other Legal Terms</h3>
				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Indemnity and Release]</strong>
					</div>
					You agree to release, indemnify and hold Indemnitees harmless from any from
					any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’
					fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death)
					arising out of or relating to your use of the Platform, any NFT Content,
					your connection to the Platform, your violation of these Terms or your
					violation of any rights of another.
				</p>

				<p>
					<div>
						<strong>[Disclaimer of Warranties]</strong>
					</div>
					Transactions on the Platform utilize experimental smart contract and
					blockchain technology, including fungible and non-fungible tokens,
					cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, and decentralized or peer-to-peer
					networks and systems. Users acknowledge and agree that such technologies
					are experimental, speculative, and inherently risky and may be subject to
					bugs, malfunctions, timing errors, hacking and theft, or changes to the
					protocol rules of the given blockchain, as well as of its forks, which can
					adversely affect the smart contracts and may expose you to a risk of total
					loss, forfeiture of your Digital Assets, or lost opportunities to buy or
					sell Digital Assets.

				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>
						SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN
